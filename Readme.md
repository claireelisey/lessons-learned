#### Things I have learned at Bloc.io:

1. How to properly structure an HTML document.
2. How to use semantic HTML tags properly.
3. Different CSS properties and values.
4. Accessibility and how to make your site more accessible.
5. An introduction to git and github and why both are important for workflow.
